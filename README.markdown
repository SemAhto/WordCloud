What it is good for
-------------------

As the name tells, this peace implements a WordCloud called collection of words displayed graphically with differenz colors, sizes and alike.

Dependencies
------------

Additionally [Microsoft's Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) is needed to run or implement this,
here especially the [Silverlight SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=28359) for developers
until that can be purged.

What does that do here?
-----------------------

This peace of software we want to handle as an example of a WordCloud written in C#, we do not intend to keep dependencies on Silverlight or may even completely abandon it.

License matters
---------------

As we found it via Stackexchange without any hint on a license, we just asked the author to decide on that matter:
